# Recon suites review

## Intro

**What?** This is a December 2020 hunting/pentesting recon suites review made by myself. I have compared and review every tool one by one and obtained a general view of the "state-of-the-art" of the most used recon tools.

**Why?** Lately there has been an explosion in the creation of these types of tools, and I was simply curious about how each one faced the challenge of profiling one or more objectives.

**How?** First, I have analyzed what features the suites have and then what tools they used to achieve those functionalities.

From my POV a recon tool should get as much information as possible from a target regardless of its size. From subdomains enumeration to analyze all JS and their possible secrets, through SSL failures or consult information in public sources. Neither am I looking for a tool that will get all the low-hanging fruit for P1 automatically continuously, let's be honest, most people are looking for this, and you don't have the necessary to set up a competent infrastructure to achieve it.

I thought about making measurements on the number of subdomains that each tool retrieves and the number of information that they retrieve in general, but this poses several problems. In the end, these suites launch existing subdomain enumeration tools, so I'll do that other day \(spoiler! ðŸ˜²\) and it doesn't really depend on the suite itself. On the other hand, each tool does different processes with different tools, so it would not be fair \(or measurable, I think\) to make a comparison of the quantity or quality of information they obtain.

My perfect recon suite should be able to do the following: run a command, review its contents, and then run another tool with that information, like "subdomain enum \| httpx \| gf \| dalfox". Yeah I know, it's a simple oneliner, but also, I want a lot of different checks in an easy readable and organized way. Easy? Let's see.

This is not intended to be a serious investigation, a technical paper, or anything like that, just a series of tests that I have done for fun. The results shown are my opinion and if at any time you don't like them, or you don't agree, you can stop reading or explain to me how I could have done it better ðŸ˜‰
{% endhint %}

All the results of my runs and tests are posted [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XVi9eKWvVZw9zrX46XEZD3LfiEMRCg327hOn4AbTZWs/edit?usp=sharing), it has three sheets \(Summary, features and tools\).

## Final thoughts

I was very surprised by the amount of very good tools that exist for recognition, I have discovered many very good tools that I did not know and others I have been able to understand better how they work. I was also surprised by how quickly nuclei has established itself as one of the best tools that exist in the panorama and on the other hand, that dorking is no longer used, even if it is simply to return a list of urls to check manually. **Bheem** seems to me to be the best tool that adapts to my work methodology and I hope they continue to maintain and update it because it does the job very well.

Finally, thanks to all the tool developers who facilitate our work and implement the recon methodology better and better.
